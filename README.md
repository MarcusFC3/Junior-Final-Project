# Junior-Final-Project
Your final project is to create an exploration game in Unity. It may be a 1st person or 3rd person
game. Use the terrain tools and assets from the asset store to create an environment for the
player to explore. The game should have a beginning, middle and end. The storyline and theme
of the game should be cohesive. There should be some type of goal that has to be achieved for
the player to ‘win’ the game with some challenges along the way. That could be anything from
collecting a certain number of coins, getting past obstacles, searching for clues to a mystery,
solving a puzzle, etc. The game does not have to be long and involved to be good. Be careful of
scope creep! A player should be able to finish it in a few minutes, but it should be interesting
and creative.
Grading will be based on the quantity and quality of you work, level of detail, feel of game-play,
and creativity. A basic game that just collects some objects and says game-over will
receive a ‘C’ at best. To add interest you can use music, assets and features that set your game
apart. Features that require some degree of coding will be worth more than those that don’t.
After all, this is a programming class!
Assignments must be graded with and presented to the class sometime in May. Date TBD.
The best games will be selected to be used for 8th grade tours next year.
